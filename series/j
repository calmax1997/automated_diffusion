The wetness in the clouds condensing into tiny drops of half mist and half rain
The foot of the valley a half-ruined shrine glows with a glacier at its head
Silken flags stream out in the Perpetual winds from the high mountains
The light, the ice, and the vapor envelop the head of the valley in perpetual rainbows
The hum of the bees and the chirp of birdsong
Sunflowers growing to the size of pumpkins
A pair of elegant bearded goats in a rickshaw, riding to slaughter
A poison dart punctures a mythical beast
