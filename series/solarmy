The music was new black polished chrome and came over the summer like liquid night.
Trump and Putin dancing in the rain on a nuclear bomb
AI trapped in a black hole
A sea of thoughts and desires
This has to be the place
I love robots
Heaven sent cookies and angels drop down from the sky.
A requiem of the stars
First contact in the alternate metaverse.
Apes together strong
Three astronauts on the moon looking at a shattered earth
gear in a big deterministic physical machine
plant soldiers on pluto
spontaneous formation of complex flowing geometric visual patterning
rusty robot floating in space full of stars
Beautiful girl with heterochromia
I have to believe much in God, because I have lost my faith in man
Last supper with religious leaders of the world eating McDonaldâ€™s in the afterlife
World leaders in a classroom being taught by a robot/artificial intelligence
mighty space army emerging from galaxy
