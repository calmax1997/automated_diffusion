an ancient alien civilisation
a surreal, organic stone monument to the modern world
We all gonna make it
a bird dressed like a thug
a bird dressed like a thug painted by picasso
a bird wearing a baseball cap
a bird wearing a baseball cap backward
a bird dressed in a hoodie
A murder of crows flies into the birds dressed like thugs
Futuristic thug bird revolution
A gangster bird flying through intergalactic piles of money
A bird with a gun is robbing a monkey
A flock of kings
Only god can judge me
A crowned bride waits among flamingoes beside a placid lake
A bird kill a king with laser gun
A solitary oak tree on a hill
A chill lax thug bests any contempt foe
A phoenix rises from neon ashes
Thug birds cruising cyber punk streets
Thug bird mugging monkey
A space thugbird with space helmet floating into the void with a lot of abstract things all around
Thug birds making graffiti
Thug bird ruling over his Dominion in space and on earth
we walk right now , but we run tomorrow
“Thug bird living the thug life in a bright parallel universe”
thugs of a feather flock together
A bird floating through space, approaching a black hole
Thugbirdz high-fives turtles.
Thug birds chillen with their banana ice cream
